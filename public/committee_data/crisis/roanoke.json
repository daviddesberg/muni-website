  "bio": "I am currently a sophomore studying history here at the University of Illinois alongside pre-law coursework.  In total I have 5 years of MUN experience under my belt and have worked 3 other conferences not counting MUNI XXII.  Simulations is the lifeblood of ever conference and I am honored to have been selected as a director.  I plan to provide an exciting and stimulating three days for every delegate that takes part in my crisis committee.  When not reading, writing, and breathing history I love to watch hockey and cheer on the Chicago Blackhawks.",
  "description": "It is year of our lord 1585; 88 men, 18 women, and 10 children have landed on the island of Roanoke to establish the first English colony in the New World for the glory of Queen Elizabeth the First.  Anglo-Spanish tensions are at an all-time high and a war is almost inevitable on both sides of the Atlantic.  You have been tasked by our governor Sir Walter Raleigh to establish a military base on this island to contest Spanish control in the unexplored and untamed region.\n\nSupplies are expected to be limited and the natives assumed to be hostile, but if our Queen’s vision for a colonial empire is to ever become reality then we must succeed.  The Spanish do not yet know of our mission but it is inevitable that they will stumble upon us, and when that happens we must be ready.  The Spaniard’s might is strong but the Englishmen’s will is stronger.  God Save the Queen and good luck colonists."
