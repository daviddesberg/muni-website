  "description": "With two words Pope Urban II launched the land of Christendom into holy war: Deus vult, God wills it. After two crusades, the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem has ruled peacefully over the Levant for almost 100 years. However, conflict between factions now threatens the fragile peace the keeps Christians and Muslims living together in harmony.\n\nViolence and anti-Muslim activity is perpetrated by the knightly orders and Europeans eager to spill blood in the name of the Lord, while landed nobility believes that peaceful coexistence is the path to stability in the Kingdom of Heaven. Meanwhile, the powerful Sultanate of Egypt struggles with internal strife, distracting them from border disputes by Christians. If the court of King Baldwin IV is unable to settle their differences before Egypt, the kingdom itself will be in danger.\n\nNow King Baldwin IV, the leper, has called the most influential members of his kingdom to decide on Jerusalem's next course of action. Merchants, pilgrims, and Lords of all faiths must come together to lead the kingdom of Heaven into its future."
