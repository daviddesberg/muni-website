    "bio": "Hi! My name is Gabriel Wacks. I’m a senior majoring in East Asian Languages and Cultures and minoring in History. I’m also pursuing an undergraduate certificate in International Security. This year I’m psyched to direct MUNI’s Joint Crisis Committee, the Taiping Rebellion, which will feature both the Imperial Court of the Qing Dynasty and the Royal Court of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Previously, I worked as a crisis staffer for MUNI’s Chinese Politburo committee, where I helped oversee China’s military affairs and ensure world-ending thermonuclear war. I’m also the Vice President of Internal Affairs for Illinois Model United Nations. When I’m not laying waste to East Asia at MUN, I’m studying Chinese or serving as a senior editor for U of I’s journal of international security. I also enjoy travelling, watching Rick and Morty, and the dankest of memes. Feel free to message me with any questions, comments, or threats regarding Illinois Model United Nations!",
    "description":"The Taiping Rebellion, led by the Heavenly King and second son of God Hong Xiuquan, has fallen into chaos. Once nearly taking the Qing capital of Beijing, the fanatical warrior-kings of the Taiping have turned on each other, laying waste to the heavenly capital in the process. Hong, self-proclaimed younger brother of Jesus Christ and liberator of China has been left without his war council, and as his leadership crumbles, so does his sanity. With tens of thousands of people lying dead in the streets of the capital and most of the military leadership gone, the rebellion has been left with a yawning power-vacuum. It is now up to the royal court, composed of hastily-promoted generals and the siblings of the Heavenly King, to seize the initiative and lead the armies of God in their conquest of all the lies under Heaven."
