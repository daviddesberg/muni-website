  "bio": "Hello! I’m Jemima Elsherbini and I’m a sophomore majoring in Integrative Biology. Once I graduate, I plan to go to medical school and become a psychiatrist. Last year I was a crisis staffer for the JCC-Iraqi Committee and this year I’m very proud to report that I’m the director for the Feudal Japan Committee! Outside of MUN, I volunteer at Carle Hospital and am currently in the process of creating a new RSO. In my (rare) free time I love to read, watch musicals, play video games, and binge watch Netflix!",
  "description":"The year is 1568. Triggered by the disastrous collapse of the Ashikaga shogunate (1336–1573), Japan has shattered into dozens of provinces and the country’s turmoil has quickly escalated into a multi-sided civil war. A puppet emperor hides in the capital of Kyoto as the warlords tear the country apart for control of the country, razing the country sides and killing thousands. Delegates become warlords, ambassadors, and missionaries who decide the fate of Japan. They must use their newfound knowledge of Japanese history, become skilled in diplomacy, and learn how to pacify a war torn country throughout the course of this committee. Will they follow the path of history or stray from the beaten path to form a new, Japan?"
