Last year I was the director for our UN Security Council, and I'm excited to bring you the JCC this year. When Iâ€™m occasionally doing things other than Model UN it's probably because I'm watching sports (and watching the Redskins, Capitals, Nationals, and Wizards break my heart) or playing TagPro, the world's greatest online capture the flag game (Seriously. Google it. You'll love it).",
  "description":"Good afternoon! My name is Vikram Sardana and I'm a junior studying Computer Science and Statistics. I've done Model UN since seventh grade (that's a long time!) and this year I have the honor of also serving as the President of Illinois Model United Nations. Two years ago I directed the Security Council, last year I directed the Gulf War JCC, and I'm excited to be running the Ad-Hoc Committee this year. Outside of MUN I spend my time watching sports (Let's Go Redskins, Nationals, Capitals, and Wizards!) and pretending to do my homework. I know some of you may be interested in a hint about what the Ad-Hoc is this year so here you go: 259."
