  "bio":"Good afternoon! My name is Vikram Sardana and I'm a junior studying Computer Science and Statistics. I've done Model UN since seventh grade (that's a long time!) and this year I have the honor of also serving as the President of Illinois Model United Nations. Two years ago I directed the Security Council, last year I directed the Gulf War JCC, and I'm excited to be running the Ad-Hoc Committee this year. Outside of MUN I spend my time watching sports (Let's Go Redskins, Nationals, Capitals, and Wizards!) and pretending to do my homework. I know some of you may be interested in a hint about what the Ad-Hoc is this year so here you go: 259.",
