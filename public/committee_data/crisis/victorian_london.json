    "description": "It is 1855 and the world’s foremost city is experiencing growing pains. Poverty, poor sanitation and inadequate administration has led to the passage of the Metropolis Management Act and creation of the Metropolitan Board of Works.  As a board, you are responsible for working behind the scenes to ensure that London is fit to be called the capital city of the great British Empire. Best of luck!"
