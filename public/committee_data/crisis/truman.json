  "bio": "I'm Lucas, a fourth year student studying Atmospheric Sciences with minors in Geology and Russian Language and Literature. I've directed and staffed every MUNI conference here for the last 3 years, including an ambitious Mars Colony Ad-Hoc for MUNI XXII. This year I'll be directing the Cabinet of President Harry S. Truman, which is shaping up to be the most robust and interactive committee that I've had the pleasure of working on. Outside of school and MUN I work on microsatellite radios as a part of SatDev UIUC, play folk guitar and harmonica, and sinking too much time and money into a children's trading card game.",
  "description":"April 1945: US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt has suddenly and unexpectedly passed, thrusting his Vice President Harry S Truman into what many consider to be the single most important position in the world. Truman and his cabinet are tasked with resolving what his predecessor initiated: swiftly ending the War in the Pacific, rebuilding a battered and broken Europe while remaining vigilant of the ever-present Soviet Union; Transitioning America from a post-depression wartime state to a stable and proud beacon of freedom; and ultimately shaping the principles and policy that will guide America well into the next century. Delegates will represent Truman's cabinet members and closest domestic allies. All should be ready to discuss and debate any matter of domestic and foreign policy and politic of this time, and to take effective and swift actions on these issues both communally and individually."
