  "bio": "I am a Junior studying History and Secondary Education and only joined MUN in college but quickly grew to love it and I hope to enjoy another year of MUNI. At MUNI XXII I was a simulations staffer for the FIFA committee in which I learned valuable experience and hope to bring to it to my new committee this year at MUNI XXIII. I love history and am willing to discuss any aspect of history from the Res publica Romana to the Heilige Romansh Kaiserreich. I also enjoys a hot cup of tea to start the day along with a scone. ",
  "description":"The Münster Rebellion of 1534 was a time of intense religious struggle, hard line pragmatism, and questions about the future of the Holy Roman Empire and central Europe. With the hostile takeover of Münster by the Anabaptists they have the ability to create a new type of state within the Holy Roman Empire, or even independent of it. As they struggle with their former ruler will they compromise their beliefs to stay alive or will they stay true to their beliefs and face the might of the established order?"
