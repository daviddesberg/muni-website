  "bio": "I am currently a sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering with minors in Electrical Engineering and Business. This is my fifth year in Model United Nations and I have participated in over 20 conferences around the world in varying capacities. This is the 2nd MUNI I have staffed. In past conferences, I have worked as a Chair, Crisis Staffer, Rapporteur, Director and Head of Conference. I will be the Simulations Director for the challenging, chaotic and at times crazy United Nations Security Council which will pit nations against each other and promises to be one of the most exhilarating simulations to date. Outside of Model UN, I enjoy watching movies and TV shows with House of Cards and Game of Thrones being my favorite series. I am also fond of traveling around the world, cooking and watching soccer and basketball with my favorite teams being Real Madrid and the Los Angeles Lakers respectively. ",
  "description": "Over the previous few months, various global security issues have become increasingly pressing. These conflicts range from the Indian Subcontinent and Korean Peninsula to the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Mexico, to name only a few. On this occasion, when international security is so deeply threatened such that the United Nations Security Council deems it necessary to meet immediately and in closed session, it creates an Ad Hoc Committee, comprised of all Council members. Expediency and pragmatism are critical to solving today’s security issues, with exacerbated concerns having the potential to intertwine and spiral out of control.  For the safety of tomorrow’s world, action has to be taken today."
