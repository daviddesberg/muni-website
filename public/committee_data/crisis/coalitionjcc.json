  "bio": "I am a sophomore studying Computer Science and Statistics. This is my eighth year partaking in this weird world of Model United Nations, and my second year involved with MUNI. Last year I was the director for our UN Security Council, and I'm excited to bring you the JCC this year. When I’m occasionally doing things other than Model UN it's probably because I'm watching sports (and watching the Redskins, Capitals, Nationals, and Wizards break my heart) or playing TagPro, the world's greatest online capture the flag game (Seriously. Google it. You'll love it).",
  "description": "Following the attack on Kuwait by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, the international community had decided to come to the defense of the small Gulf Kingdom to maintain national sovereignty and regional stability. A Coalition Force of the NATO and Arab nations has joined together to defeat the Iraqi rogue state, but they must act quickly and responsibly in resolving the crisis. The stability of Kuwait, Iraq and the entire Middle East lie in question, while pressure from humanitarian groups, oil importers and military personal all play a role in the decision-making process for the Coalition. And all while balancing conflicts among themselves, the body faces off with a resilient and fierce opponent in Baghdad. "
