  "director": "Ryan Mathiu",
  "bio": "I am a senior studying Finance with a minor in Political Science. This is my third year of my Model United Nations career and I have chaired a committee in the past and staffed as an actor my freshman year. My favorite part of the Model United Nations is the ability to witness my teammate’s manifested passions for niche topics. When not taking a part of Model United Nations I enjoy watching stand-up comedy, supporting Chelsea FC and reading the Wall Street Journal. I am excited not only for this committee but also what’s in store for you across the MUNI weekend.",
  "description": "The FIFA World Cup is the most watched global event in human history, with a billion viewers tuning in every four years. While this global spectacle is known for its famous sports stars, national pride and global celebration of the game, selection and management of the host city for the event is decided upon behind the closed doors of the FIFA Executive Board Committee. In 2010, this Board will approve the bidding process of the next lottery for the 2018 and 2020 World Cups, crucially deciding the future of the sport.\n\nAs a member of the Executive Board Committee, you will be tasked with making these critical decisions that will literally affect the entire world. The future of a global sport rests in the choices you make. So, where will the greatest game of football be held?"
