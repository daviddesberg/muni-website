  "bio": "I am a sophomore studying Computer Science and Statistics. This is my eighth year partaking in this weird world of Model United Nations, and my second year involved with MUNI. Last year I was the director for our UN Security Council, and I'm excited to bring you the JCC this year. When I’m occasionally doing things other than Model UN it's probably because I'm watching sports (and watching the Redskins, Capitals, Nationals, and Wizards break my heart) or playing TagPro, the world's greatest online capture the flag game (Seriously. Google it. You'll love it).",
  "description": "For Saddam Hussein and his loyal Ba’ath Party, maintaining control over the state of Iraq was of paramount importance in every issue, from domestic strife to international conflict. When accusations of Kuwaiti tapping of Iraqi oil reserves arose, Iraq had no option but to declare war on the Gulf State assert this control. The invasion of Kuwait was swift, but now Hussein and his supporters face off against one of the greatest coalition forces ever assembled, along with local issues both at home and in the newly occupied territories. But unity in defense of the party has always been the guiding policy for the Iraqi government administration and this unity has changed the world before. Today’s victory builds the road for a prosperous Iraq tomorrow."
