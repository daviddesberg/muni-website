  "bio": "I am a Freshman here at the University studying Economics and I have plans on going on to graduate school to do research, publish, and teach--just so I can wax on for hours on political economic theory with my PhD. I did Model United Nations all four years in high school with cabinets, JCCs, and historical committees being my favorite experiences. When I'm not in Model UN, I'm usually working out, listening to podcasts, or discovering new music (hit me up!). I look forward to working with you all to build an exciting, dynamic, and brutal senate floor.",

  "description":"Welcome to the Senate of these United States; this body is responsible for legislating the laws of the land (alongside the House), affirming foreign policy, and representing the interests of the States in this federal republic. Today the United States is overstretched domestically and abroad--being the premier world power with hundreds of military bases and dozens of allies at its disposal. However, this reach is limited in its scope towards the Arctic and Africa--areas of increasing encroachment by international rivals. This body takes to heart republican values: this means that all delegates are expected to accurately represent the interests of their constituencies. In addition, delegates are also expected to understand the pressure of their political party and whips. Striking a balance between innovative ideas, political re-election, and party pressure will be key in demonstrating good delegate skills. Through simulating these Senate procedures, we will be able to further our public speaking, intuition, and gain insight into the political struggles of the Senate."
