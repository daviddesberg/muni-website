  "description": "The Illinois General Assembly is the main legislative body responsible for governing, or at least attempting to govern, the State of Illinois. The past year or so has been tumultuous, to say the least. The unresolved budget crises, with leaders engaged in an unrelenting stalemate have brought the state to its knees. Universities have laid off thousands with some coming to the brink of shutting down. Social Services have been decimated, with thousands being laid off and millions going without care. Representatives will have to navigate these uncharted waters all while dealing with stubborn leaders and extremely vocal constituents. Representatives, you will have your hands full. Good luck, and Godspeed."
