  "description": "It’s 1917. The Tsar has been removed from power and memory of the Great War remains fresh in Europe’s memory. Russia has entered a period of uneasy stability as the provisional government struggles to hold the empire together. As borders are redrawn and maps are rewritten throughout Eastern Europe, Russia has found itself unsure of its own place in the world. Revolt, mutiny, conflict and revolution all seem so close ...As members of the Fourth Duma it’s up to you, the delegates, to shape Russia’s destiny and rewrite history. The fate of Russia - and the world - depends on you."
