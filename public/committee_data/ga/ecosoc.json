  "description": "The role of the Economic and Social Committee in the United Nations is to sustain and maintain civil society. This year, MUNI’s ECOSOC will have delegates dive into intense policy discussion on two critical issues plaguing international politics. The first topic will tackle the goals set out in the September 2015 UN Sustainable Development Summit. Delegates will undergo intense deliberation to create solutions for world hunger, absolute poverty, resilient infrastructure and gender inequality. While the first topic looks to address the root of sustainable issues, the second topic calls upon delegates to establish methods for upholding international humanitarian law. The second topic will echo ECOSOC’s Humanitarian Affairs Segment. Through distinguishing ideal from pragmatic laws delegates will search for the overarching role the United Nations has in upholding Human Rights. "
