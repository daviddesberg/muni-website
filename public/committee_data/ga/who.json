  "description": "The World Health Organization (WHO) is a body of the UN whose main responsibilities in the simplest terms relate to the overall health and care of the worldâ€™s population. They are instrumental in pioneering new medical research and rolling out healthcare to every corner of the globe. Along with this, the WHO has a large responsibility when it comes to disease outbreaks and health epidemics, needing to secure international cooperation, the risk of spread stays as limited as possible, and ensure that proper care is being delivered. In this committee, we will focus on two topics, the spread of disease in developing nations, and the health effects of the illicit drug trade; both topics that perplex world leaders today. Delegates in the WHO will be tasked with very real problems facing the world today and will be forced to use their skills of cooperation and writing to ensure that the best possible solution is found."
