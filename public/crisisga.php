                    The Crisis GA is a fresh take on what it means to be in a large committee. A Crisis GA is a type of committee that is a hybrid of a large committee and a crisis committee. While most GA committees tend to feature static debate, the Crisis GA challenges delegates by adding dynamic events to debate in the form of crises and other mechanics that have historically been confined to smaller crisis committees. This type of committee poses a fundamentally unique challenge for delegates because delegates have to be highly adaptable and quick on their feet (much like a crisis committee) while also being able to build consensus and act collectively (not unlike a traditional GA). Unlike a crisis committee, delegates in a Crisis GA cannot rely solely on individual action through personal powers, as their power comes from their coalition and the partners they make. This type of committee is ideal for adventurous delegates who enjoy GA committees but also enjoy dynamic debate.
