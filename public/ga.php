                <p>
                This year at MUNI, our vision for the General Assembly committees is to have them cover topics
                that are relevant to our world today and can give the delegates insights into the issues in a way
                that no other experience can. Since my Freshman year of high school, I have participated in
                Model UN and it has been an experience unlike any other. From representing a broad range of
                nations to covering a unique spread of topics at conferences around the world, I was able to
                learn things that were beyond the reach of the average high school student. My own Model UN
                experience has inspired me to transform the committees at MUNI this year such that every
                delegate walks away from committee with the same sense of knowledge gained. From the
                General Assembly, our vision is to have delegates focus and obtain the following goals:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:bullets;font-size:16px">
                    <li>Gain a new unique sense of relevant world issues from a truly immersive experience</li>
                    <li>Be able to view these issues from a unique perspective</li>
                    <li>Learn what must be done in order to solve them</li>
                </ul>  
                </p>
                <p>
                Our other goal this year for our committees in general is to help all the delegates develop skills,
                that not only will help them in future conferences, but will help them succeed at other things in
                life. We ensure this by only choosing our best and brightest members to help design and lead
                the committees and help the delegates along the way such that every delegate, regardless of
                them winning an award or not, walks away from the conference on Sunday having left their
                comfort zone and put a new set of skills to the test. Our vision is to have every delegate
                develop in the following ways:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:bullets;font-size:16px">
                    <li>Gain confidence and skill in professional speaking</li>
                    <li>Develop writing skills that will be put to the test in committee</li>
                    <li>Learn how to implement these skills in order to bring about success</li>
                </ul>  
                </p>
                <p>
