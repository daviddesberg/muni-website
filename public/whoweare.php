                <p>
                    Model United Nations is an educational activity steeped in tradition. For decades, Model United Nations has taught students about international relations and global politics. As our world has become more globalized and interconnected, the value of Model United Nations has increased exponentially as knowledge about foreign affairs has become an integral part of creating a well-rounded citizen.
                    In the spirit of this rich tradition, the Illinois Model United Nations competitive team established its high school conference with the purpose of introducing high school students to the United Nations, foreign affairs, and negotiation. Over the years, MUNI has evolved into a conference that not only values its educational roots, but also has a focus on challenging delegates by putting them in dynamic and competitive political environments. Today, MUNI blends both its educational focus with healthy competition to create a challenging and intellectually stimulating experience.

                <h3><span class="illinois-blue-text">OUR CONFERENCE</span> <span class="illinois-orange-text">MODEL</span></h3>
                <p>
                    While other conferences focus strictly on either education or competition, MUNI is different because of its unique conference model. Due to the fact that the members of Illinois Model United Nations spend their time on the collegiate circuit, MUNI adapts the collegiate circuit model for the high school audience. This enables MUNI to better emulate the real world. At MUNI, we show the nuances of the intersections between consensus building, national policy, departmental interests (as seen in cabinets) and different negotiation styles. MUNI challenges delegates to strike the balance between individual action, consensus building, idealism, and pragmatism.

                <h3><span class="illinois-blue-text">STIMULATING</span> <span class="illinois-orange-text">COMMITTEES</span></h3>
                <p>
                    MUNI features a diverse mix of committees. We hope to offer committees for delegates of every persuasion. Thus, MUNI is committed to having a wide variety of forums for debate. Our Crisis Directors and Research Directors work closely with our Secretariat and other staffers to provide committees with various educational themes, subject matters, and time periods. In the interest of variety, we design crisis committees, General Assembly committees, and even a crisis General Assembly hybrid. MUNI offers something for every delegate regardless of interest or skill level.

                <h3><span class="illinois-blue-text">KNOWLEDGEABLE</span> <span class="illinois-orange-text">STAFF</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Above all else, MUNI’s staff is its greatest asset. MUNI has been the vehicle through which students at the University of Illinois have realized their professional and academic passions. Much of the diversity in our committees can be attributed to our staffers. Given that our staffers choose their committees, subject matters, and themes, they develop a personal stake in their simulations and work diligently to create an experience that is memorable and true to MUNI’s mission. This dedication is MUNI’s backbone and will continue to be for years to come.
