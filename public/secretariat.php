                        I am a Junior here at UIUC majoring in Global Studies and minoring in both Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies as well as International Development Economics. In addition, I am pursuing certificates in Global Security and International Development Studies. Aside from serving as your Secretary-General for MUNI XXIII, I am also involved with the Illinois MUN travel team and serve as the Senior Editor for the Illini Journal of International Security. Last year, I served as the USG of Registration for MUNI XXII and before that, as a crisis staffer for the Irish Revolution committee at MUNI XXI. This will therefore be my third year staffing MUNI and being involved in Illinois MUN. I have also served as the Political Officer for the 1994 Historical Security Council at CIMUN XIII last December and am excited to return to the Department of Simulations there this upcoming November-December. Outside of Model UN and my previously mentioned commitments, I enjoy playing guitar, running and working out, hunting, binge watching Netflix, and of course, crafting the finest quality artisan memes here at UIUC. We have a lot of new things in store for all of you who attend or staff MUNI XXIII and I cannot wait to see you all in March!

                        Hi! My name is Peggy Kern and I am a sophomore majoring in English with a minor in East Asian Languages and Cultures. After my undergraduate career, I plan on attending law school and eventually pursuing family law -- focusing on divorce in particular.
                        This year I am ecstatic to be given the opportunity to serve as the Deputy Secretary General for MUNI XXIII. Serving second in command to the Secretary General is something I knew I wanted to do since last MUNI, where I served as the Undersecretary General of Merchandising and Public Relations. This is my second year serving on secretariat, and fourth year of doing MUN overall. Besides MUN, I am also involved in band, pre-law honors society, and my sorority. I also enjoy playing the flute and piano, golfing, watching Avatar: The Last Airbender, reading, and travelling (I’ve been to over 20 countries and hope to at least double that throughout my life).

                        I am a Sophomore pursuing a Political Science degree with a minor in Business and Urban Planning.  This will be my 6th year of Model United Nations, and my second year on MUNI Secretariat.

Outside of Illinois Model UN, I’m an avid Caddie, as well as an aggressive Super Smash Bros player.

                        I am a junior majoring in history with a focus on the Middle East, but with plans on going to law school to study elder law.  This is my seventh year of Model United Nations and third year being involved with MUNI.  For my first two MUNIs I was a crisis director leading the Irish Revolution and the Roanoke committees both of which provided great opportunities for delegates to learn about areas of history that are not usually covered in high school classes and I hope to provide these same kinds of unique experiences now that I am leading the department of simulations.  Outside of Model UN you can find me reading various history books, watching the Chicago Blackhawks (That is if they don’t get knocked out first round), or being overly obsessed with lampshades and other forms of lighting.

                        Hi! My name is Gordon Young and I am very excited to serve as the President of the GA for MUNI this year. I am currently a Sophomore majoring in Political Science and this will be my sixth year doing Model UN. Throughout high school, I competed as a delegate at conferences around the world, and in my college years I have continued to help run conferences including MUNI and CIMUN. Outside of Model UN, I work as a camp counselor at Phantom Lake in Wisconsin and am a member of a fraternity. If you have any questions about this year’s GAs or U of I in general feel free to reach out to me!

                        Hello! My name is William Armiros and I am the Under-Secretary General of Rules and Procedures for MUNI XXIII. That means I’m in charge of writing the exceptionally exciting parliamentary procedure for the conference and ensuring all the committee chairs know it. 
                        I am a junior majoring in computer engineering with a minor in technology and management. Outside of school I’m involved in our travelling MUN team, some engineering organizations, and my fraternity. This will be my sixth year of doing MUN and third year staffing MUNI, so I know my way around the conference pretty well by now. I chaired two committees during the last two years and am looking forward to see many of them back at MUNI as well as the hundreds of new faces we get to see every year. If you have any questions about parly pro or life at U of I I’m your guy!

This is my second year of doing Model UN, and first year on Secretariat serving as USG of Logistics. Usually you can find me tearing my hair out dealing with hotels or figuring out how to get delegates from point A to point B. When I do manage to have free time, I enjoy crying over Capitals hockey, wasting time playing Kingdom of Loathing, and painting miniature Warhammer 40k models.

I look forward to seeing you all at the MUNI XXIII store come this spring! Besides MUN I enjoy spending time outdoors, watching the hit show Vikings, going to Cubs games, or hanging out at my sorority house, Phi Sigma Sigma. Can’t wait to see all your smiling faces.

This is my first year doing Model UN, and I’m excited to gain so much experience in solving real world problems as a team and public speaking. Model UN is an extremely unique experience to me, as it is one of the only organizations that work as solving global scale problems on an international basis, which also requires an agreement between all types of diverse groups. Outside of Model UN, I love to play ultimate frisbee, watching The Office, and being part of a concert band.
