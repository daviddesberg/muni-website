                        I am a senior pursuing a double major in Operations Management and Marketing with a minor in International Development Economics. This will be my 6th and final year of Model United Nations and the 8th conference that I have staffed on the Midwestern Circuit. I have directed the Joint Crisis Committee for MUNI XIX and MUNI XX and I served as Chief of Staff for MUNI XXI. Model U.N. has been a large part of my life for a very long time and I am thrilled to be your Secretary General for MUNI XXII. When I’m not doing something Model U.N. related (which is rare), I like to play Settlers of Catan and watch B-movies like Rollertown.

                        My name is Spencer Haydary, and I serve as the Chief of Staff for MUNI XXII. I’m originally from Rockford, IL and I am a Senior studying Psychology and Communication. One day, I hope to run a non-profit, and eventually to work for the United Nations, or serve in the Department of State. I am also involved in the Illinois Student Senate, where I serve as the Student Body Vice-President Internal. Outside of school, I am an Eagle Scout, and a Master in Tae Kwon Do.

                        I am a sophomore majoring in Global Studies focusing in Governance, Conflict, and Resolution. In addition to my major, I am minoring in Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies and pursuing certificates in Global Security and International Development. This is my second year of Model United Nations and second year being involved with MUNI. Last year, at MUNI XXI, I had a great time serving as crisis staff for the Irish Revolution committee. This year, I am excited to serve as the USG of Registration for MUNI XXII. Joining Model UN has easily been one of the best decisions of my college career and I plan on channeling my passion for it into ensuring that this year’s MUNI is the best one yet. Outside of living and breathing Model UN, I spend most of my time practicing guitar, working out, watching The Walking Dead and House of Cards, and crafting memes.

I am a freshman here at Illinois, currently double majoring in Political Science and Communications.  Although this is my first year participating in MUNI, I have competed in Model United Nations for the past four years at my high school. I have staffed four committees during my career.  Model UN has been my favorite activity for the past five years of my life, and I am excited to facilitate a great experience for this year’s delegates. Outside of the political sphere, I enjoy playing intramural sports as well as beating my roommates at Super Smash Bros.

I am a junior at the University of Illinois pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have been involved with Model United Nations since my sophomore year of high school, and MUNI XXII marks the second time I have served on Secretariat. My goal is to ensure that every technology-related component of the conference &mdash; from the web site, to the registration process, to printing during the weekend of the conference &mdash; runs as smoothly as possible. Outside of Model UN, I enjoy playing basketball, listening to music, and crafting memes.

I am a senior studying Finance and Accountancy with a minor in History. This is the 6th year of my my Model United Nations career and the 4th MUNI I have staffed. In the past, I have worked as a Simulations Director, Chair and Crisis Staffer, so running the department was my last stop on the simulations path. I am proud to help bring to life seven excellent committees this year and I know my staff are equally excited to as well. When not taking part in Model United Nations, I enjoy practicing karate, watching college football and reading The Economist.

                        I am a senior majoring in Philosophy with a double minor in Political Science and Gender and Women’s Studies. This is my eighth year in Model UN and my fourth year in Illinois Model UN, as well as my first year on secretariat. Additionally, I was the head of our competitive travel team my sophomore year. Model UN has been incredibly influential in my life, connecting me to some wonderful people and providing me with a skill set that I utilize in my academic and activist work. Outside of MUN, I’m a student activist and I love to cook and listen to death metal (sometimes at the same time!). I’m very excited to run the GAs this year, and I hope they prove to be the most challenging and exciting GAs at MUNI to date. I look forward to meeting many of you come March!
