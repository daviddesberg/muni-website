                <p>
                    The <em>Ad Hoc</em> Committee of the Secretary General (<em>Ad Hoc</em>) is a committee type that is typically offered on the conference circuit. While the <em>Ad Hoc</em> operates like most other crisis committees, it is designed to simulate crisis management and operating with minimal preparation. To do this, the research materials are released right before the conference so delegates must work quickly to build their policy. In short, the subject matter of an <em>Ad Hoc</em> Committee is supposed to be a surprise.

                    If Model United Nations was a sport, then the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Committee is the Super Bowl. This committee is designed to challenge delegates who are well-versed in crisis committees and are no strangers to thinking on their feet and solving problems with minimal preparation.

                    The background guide for the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Committee will be released on March 6, 2017 and delegate assignments will be released on March 9, 2017.

                <h3>Crisis Director: Andrew Maikisch</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Andrew Maikisch, and I am a freshman studying Political Science. This is my first year both participating in Model United Nations and staffing a MUNI conference. I am proud to be the director of a committee in my first year, and I am determined to make it the best committee there has ever been. I intend to use my enthusiasm for my simulation to create a committee that is both educational and very enjoyable for the delegates. Beyond the Model United Nations meetings, I spend my time cheering for the Capitals, playing League of Legends, and keeping up with the burning mess that is current American politics.
