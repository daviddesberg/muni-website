                <h3><span class="illinois-blue-text">Letter from the Secretary-General:<span class="illinois-orange-text"></span></h3>
                <p>
                With last year’s inaugural edition of the Ad-Hoc Committee of the Secretary-General, Red Alert 2047: The Colonization of Mars, I believe we added a valuable aspect to our conference. Last year’s director, Drew Maikisch, who is now serving as USG of Logistics and Operations, executed our most elite committee we’ve ever had the pleasure of running for your delegates. This year, we wanted to top that. Director Vikram Sardana, the head delegate of our travel team, has proven that he is up to the challenge. As you read his letter, it should become clear that this will in no way be a typical crisis committee. Committee information, positions, and the background guide and any other substantive information will not be released until a week before the conference at the earliest. Most information will be released a day before or day of. However, we will be sending out some very cryptic updates regarding the simulation in the few weeks leading up to conference that you will be asked to forward to your delegates. To advisors: put only your most elite delegates into this committee. It is sure to be the most difficult committee that they have ever experienced. To delegates: good luck — you’ll need it. Also, if you know people in our organization that you went to highschool with, don’t bother asking them the Ad-Hoc topic. They don’t know it and we on Secretariat won’t be thrilled about you trying to get ahead that way.
                </p>

                Best,<br>

                <h3>Crisis Director: Vikram Sardana</h3>
                <p>
                So, you’re in Ad-Hoc! Congratulations, and welcome to the most challenging committee you’ll have ever been in.
                </p>
                <p> 
                First a tiny bit about myself - my name is Vikram Sardana, and I’m a Junior studying Computer Science and Statistics. I’ve done MUN since seventh grade, and highlights of committees I’ve directed are a Middle School UNSC (twice), The Washington Redskins, a JCC based on the book Jennifer Government, the UNSC for MUNI XXI, and the Gulf War JCC for MUNI XXII last year. I also serve as President of Illinois Model United Nations and the head delegate for our travel team this year.
                </p>
                <p> 
                But that’s enough about me because this committee isn’t about me… it’s about you.
                </p>
                <p> 
                Updates are going to be primarily driven by the committee directives passed and the personal directives written - this is supposed to be the hardest Model United Nations committee, not a book. Be reasonable but be creative and you’ll have a good time.
                </p>
                <p> 
                The Ad-Hoc is meant to make you think on your feet, so you won’t be getting committee information until right before conference or day of. Some people might say that you can’t handle that because you’re only high schoolers. You’re going to prove them wrong.
                </p> 
                <p> 
                That being said, if committee is going to be as amazing as we all know it can be, let’s agree on some things you shouldn’t do.
                <ul style="list-style-type:bullets;font-size:16px">
                <li>Don’t write boring directives that don’t do anything - you’re wasting your time more than mine anyway.</li>
                <li>Don’t give up - committee is way more fun and exciting if everybody is going their hardest the entire time. You won’t be in Ad-Hoc the weekend after MUNI, you can relax then.</li>
                <li>Don’t write dumb personal directives - you can be creative to expand your powers and do cool stuff (please do!) but be smart about it. Once in a NATO crisis committee as Norway, I decided to poison all fish shipments to Russia. That was dumb. Don’t do that.</li>
                <li>Don’t argue over things like sponsor order and stuff - the chairs and staff weren't born yesterday, they know who’s doing well without that nonsense.</li>
                <li>Don’t do weird powerdel type stuff - I promise you that whatever you’ve done, I’ve done. Chill on that for this committee.</li>
                <li>If you get an update about there being riots, don’t just only write a press release. Figure out something better to do with riots or protests or just ignore them. No good director has ever cared about a meaningless press release.</li>
                <li>Don’t be afraid to go on the attack in speeches and stuff, but don’t go over the line - you’re representing a character ultimately, don’t start personally attacking anybody. Nobody appreciates any of that and it’s a good way to get yourself disqualified for awards consideration.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p> 
                I know at some schools they have some designated delegate or advisor email all the directors asking for feedback. If that’s what happens then fine, but I’d really rather prefer that if you want feedback on your performance that you be the one to email me instead of an advisor or some other kid. If I’m giving you feedback I want to refer to specific things that happen in committee, and that’ll make more sense if you’re actually there.
                </p>
                <p> 
                Awards policy will be simple - the best few delegates will get awards, based on your frontroom presence (speaking and writing and passing group directives) and your backroom work (both skill and creativity in writing personal notes and having them impact the committee’s crisis arc). I’m sure this is going to be a super intense committee, and while I hope that some people don’t feel like they were robbed, it happens. I’ve been there before and I know it sucks, so if that happens, you can email me at vsardan2@illinois.edu and we can talk.
                </p>
                <p> 
                Finally, if you have buddies in MUN here, don’t bother asking them about the Ad-Hoc topic. First of all, they don’t know it. Second of all, that’s bush league. You’re better than that.
                </p>
                <p> 
                I’ll see you March 9th.
                </p>
                <p> 
                Sincerely,<br>
                Vikram Sardana<br> 
                Ad-Hoc Committee Director | MUNI XXIII
