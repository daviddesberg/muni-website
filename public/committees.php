                    Welcome to the main committees page of our website!
                </p>
                <p>
Now that our committees and their topics have been mostly finalized, you are able to click on the department links below to view our committees! Our department heads, USG of Simulations Michael Lawlor and PGA Gordon Young, have been working hard with directors to make sure we build our committees on the foundations of education and skill development. To that end, they have defined their personal goals and visions for their respective departments and have asked their Directors to do the same for their specific committees. These committee specific goals, along with Director bios will be posted as the committees take shape. Our aim in doing this is to give advisors the best picture of what our conference has to offer and also inform delegates about what they can expect to get out of their attendance here at MUNI.
                </p>
<p>
If you have any questions or concerns about committees at all, you can contact USG of Registration Danny Benson at <a href="mailto:registration@illinoismun.org">registration@illinoismun.org</a>. Contact info for Mike and Gordon will be posted on their respective pages and when the time comes for Background Guides and Position Papers, Directors will also have their contact info posted. Be sure to like our Facebook Page “Model United Nations at the University of Illinois” at <a href="https://fb.me/munixxiii">fb.me/munixxiii</a> to stay informed on our committee plans. Our posts in the coming months will be focusing in on interviews with directors (in which they will give special tips about how to do well in their committee) along with other committee related content like an early reveal of our Ad-Hoc committee! If your delegates ever need a quick way to get in contact with us, they can always message us through our FB page as well!

                <h3><span class="illinois-blue-text">Committee Updates,</span> <span class="illinois-orange-text">Goals, and Policies</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Here at MUNI, as stated on our Who We Are page, we strive to provide delegates with the most memorable and beneficial
                    experience that a MUN conference can offer. Our committee staff go above and beyond accomplishing this goal year after
                    year through rigorous training, expertise, and a focus on education and skill building. This is compounded by offering a
                    diverse range of dynamic committees set in historical, present day, and near future time periods in theaters across the world
                    at differing levels of society, the private sector, and government. Every year, our committee staff offers up new subject areas
                    often based in their majors and passions. Whether its science, business, politics, war, nation building, utopian/dystopian
                    societies, colonization, revolution, etc., every delegate is sure to find something for them due to the training and diversity —
                    both in background and education — of our most valuable asset: our staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have many new things to offer delegates this year to make sure they get the most out of their time preparing for and
                    attending MUNI. This includes implementing a new education and skill building debrief in every committee between staff and delegates as well as a formal online delegate feedback system. Check back on this page from late-August through mid-
                    September for new updates as well as our defined goals for education and skill building!
